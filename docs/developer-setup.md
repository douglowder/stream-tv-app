# Developer setup

We are currently aiming to support Amazon FireStick. Other platforms are preferrably to be supported at any point, but is not a priority.

At the moment the most actual React Native version is `0.64.2`, however versions `0.64.*` have a bug, that Touchable components do not invoke `onFocus` callbacks when focused (which is the only way for us to handle highlughting while navigating via remote control).

Thus, the application is currently running `0.63.4`.
